Some sample code.
Some of these were part of huge projects and not easily plug-and-play. I don't
promise that they work in a basic installation without configuration, even with
dependant modules.

I still have two more modules that are much more interesting, but it seems they
have undergone some changes by others since last pull / update. They also might
have some data that I am not allowed to share. I need to go through those before
adding to this repo.

breadcrumb_block
  An extremely simple module that only creates a block with a breadcrumb that
  can be displayed wherever. I used this with Panels in a multi-site configuration
  when a theme template was too static.

isotope_commerce_catalogue
  Depends on Views Isotope (and Commerce Kickstart). This module creates a
  catalogue view of products that can be filtered with the jQuery isotope
  plugin. It also adds to and overrides functionality provided by the
  Views Isotope module.

materialordering
  Creates a multi-step form to download or order materials by email using Views.
  Also includes some customization to add contact information.
  Depends on Views Inputfield (below).

views_inputfield
  A simple plugin to provide the possibility to use an input field in a view.

responsive-navigation.js
  I've used this method in a couple of projects to toggle display of navigation
  menus and other elements for mobile devices.
